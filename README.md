Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Crop Production Analysis in India! As part of my internship with Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing sales data.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Crop Production data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. I also used machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future sales.

I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to dive into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.![Screenshot 2024-05-21 203729](https://github.com/Savio9481/Crop-Production-Analysis-in-India/assets/148083814/4b61ac7a-e818-4e87-b78f-a17f15659f8b)
